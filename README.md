Fire Simulation in Rust

Written by ChatGPT o1-preview

Prompt:
Write a complete Rust program that, when executed, will display a fire simulation. It must run on a mac.

Result:

Certainly! Below is a complete Rust program that simulates fire in the terminal using the crossterm crate. This program should run on a Mac and displays a dynamic fire effect in your terminal window. Press q or Esc to exit the simulation.

Instructions:

Create a new Rust project:

bash
Copy code
cargo new fire_simulation
cd fire_simulation
Replace the contents of Cargo.toml with the provided Cargo.toml content.

Replace the contents of src/main.rs with the provided main.rs code.

Run the program:

bash
Copy code
cargo run
The fire simulation should now display in your terminal. Press q or Esc to exit.

Notes:

The program uses the crossterm crate for terminal manipulation, which is cross-platform and should work on macOS.
The rand crate is used for random number generation.
Ensure your terminal supports true color (24-bit color) for the best visual effect.
The simulation uses the classic "Doom Fire" algorithm to create the fire effect.
Feel free to adjust the FIRE_WIDTH and FIRE_HEIGHT constants to fit your terminal size or desired effect.
